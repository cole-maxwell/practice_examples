This directory contains VHDL example code that I'm using as a basis to build synthesizable projects and test benches. The examples are from the textbooks 'Reconfigurable Computing' by Hauck and Dehon and 'The Designer's Guide to VHDL' by Peter Ashenden.

Each project directory generally has the following structure:

/bench  :   contains the testbench for simulation
/data   :   contains data files to feed simulation
/doc    :   any resources or documentation
/rtl    :   vhdl source code
/sw     :   source code to program hps
/syn    :   projects in vivado and quartus
